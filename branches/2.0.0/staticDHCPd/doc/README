Thirty-second upgrade guide for people who hate using diff:
    Install and go. Except in very rare cases, which will be documented here,
    your old conf.py, extensions, and scripting logic will be
    forwards-compatible with this version.
    
    If coming from anything before 1.6.1, move conf.py into the conf/ directory
    or create /etc/staticDHCPd/ and move it there. Your old file needs no TLC.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Installation instructions:
    Run install.sh with privileges that can create content in
    /etc and /usr/local/bin. Follow the resulting on-screen text to integrate
    the server with your OS's daemon-management engine.
    
    Just remember to set up conf.py and everything should Just Work(TM). Before
    installing the server, though, run through the five-minute quickstart
    described below; it doesn't require that you make any permanent changes to
    your host and it'll run out of the source distribution as-is.

Five-minute "does this really work?" setup guide for busy administrators
    Uses an INI file or sqlite3 to avoid unnecessary installations

(If you need more information, see the project page at

 http://code.google.com/p/staticdhcpd/)


Step 1: Gather resources
    You need the code, which came with this lovely text file, and a computer
    on which to run it. Since this is a Unix-formatted file, you've probably
    already got that, too. You'll also need sqlite3 to manage the DHCP
    database. Chances are it's already installed, but check anyway. (Also
    Python 2.5+, but no modern Unix-like system is without that)
    
    The last thing you need is enough access to bind to the DHCP ports.
    Since there's no way you're going to just run this server on a production
    box without testing it first, you've almost certainly satisfied this
    requirement, too.
    
    So you're done. That was easy.
    
Step 2: Set up the DHCP database
    (This example assumes your network is similar to that of a typical home
    user; if this is not the case, you will need to adjust things, but you
    probably wouldn't be playing with a DHCP server if you were a typical home
    user anyway)
    
    The example values below will give the MAC 'aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff' the IP
    '192.168.0.197' and no hostname. You'll notice that non-host-specific
    parameters are inherited from its subnet-classification, specifically
    things like lease-time and basic routing parameters. DNS, NTP, and
    other properties aren't specified in this example, but are in the samples/
    directory.
    
    (The term "subnet" is used loosely here: the only thing that matters is that
    the "subnet" and "serial" values match for inheritance -- you could put
    "floor 3" in as a "subnet" if you wanted to. The term "subnet" was chosen
    because it seemed like the most likely classification system for
    administrators to use and recognise; similarly, "serial" is also up to you,
    it just allows for multiple definitions within the same "subnet" -- you
    might want to use the VLAN, or maybe you'll just always make it 0)
    
    INI method:
        Create a file with the following contents; the name is up to you.
            
            [192.168.0.0/24|0]
            lease-time: 14400
            gateway: 192.168.0.1
            subnet-mask: 255.255.255.0
            broadcast-address: 192.168.0.255

            [aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff]
            ip: 192.168.0.197
            subnet: 192.168.0.0/24
            serial: 0
            
    SQLite method:
        Open a terminal and run `sqlite3 dhcp.sqlite3`
        
        Copy and paste the contents of samples/sqlite.sql into the prompt.
        
        Now that your database is ready to go (SQLite is easy), add some rules.
            
            INSERT INTO subnets (
                subnet,
                serial,
                lease_time,
                gateway,
                subnet_mask,
                broadcast_address,
                ntp_servers,
                domain_name_servers,
                domain_name
            ) VALUES (
                '192.168.0.0/24',
                0,
                14400,
                '192.168.0.1',
                '255.255.255.0',
                '192.168.0.255',
                NULL,
                NULL,
                NULL
            );
            
            INSERT INTO maps (
                mac,
                ip,
                hostname,
                subnet,
                serial
            ) VALUES (
                'aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff',
                '192.168.0.197',
                NULL,
                '192.168.0.0/24',
                0
            );
            
Step 3: Set up conf.py
    Copy 'conf/conf.py.sample' to 'conf/conf.py'.
    
    Edit the file and make the following changes:
        Set DAEMON to False. If you don't, it'll do daemonsy things, like kill
        console output and detach from the controlling terminal, which aren't
        good for helping to identify configuration problems quickly.
        
        Set DHCP_SERVER_IP to whichever IP you want to listen on.
        
        INI method:
            Set DATABASE_ENGINE to 'INI'; capitalization matters.
            
            Add the line "INI_FILE = '/home/you/that-ini-file-you-created'"
            
        SQLite method:
            Set DATABASE_ENGINE to 'SQLite'; capitalization matters.
            
            Add the line "SQLITE_FILE = '/home/you/that-sqlite-file-you-created'"
            
Step 4: Start the server
    Run `sudo python staticDHCPd`.
    
    You should see a bunch of lines appear, explaining that the server is now
    running.
    
    Tell the device with the MAC given in step 3 to request an address and
    everything should Just Work(tm).
    
    Go to http://localhost:30880/ if you want to check out the web interface.
    
Step 5: Kill the process
    When satisifed that the system works, hit ^C or send SIGTERM (15) to the
    process.
    
    
You now have proof that what you have in your proverbial hands is a functional,
ready-to-customise DHCP server.
