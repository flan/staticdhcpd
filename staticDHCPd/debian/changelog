staticdhcpd (2.0.0) unstable; urgency=low
  
  * Debian package support, at long last!
  
  * Proper documentation!
  
  * Logging improvements everywhere.

  * Massive networking logic rewrites in conjunction with libpydhcpserver.
    - Of key value is that this addresses issue 15, meaning that systems,
      often embedded, that can't or won't listen for broadcast DHCP responses
      can now be served via UNICAST response to their MACs.
    - qtags are also supported via this method.
      
  * More flexibility in determining where packets go, in case specific clients
    require responses at/from odd addresses.
  
  * Clients with weird chomp-like behaviour that always eats one byte past END
    will now receive a PAD-byte at the end of a packet if they sent one, too.
  
  * All cacheable databases (which is most of them) now have support for
    local caching on disk, instead of just memory, and for persistent on-disk
    caching, in case the database server is sometimes unreachable.
    
  * All databases now support "extra" parameters, allowing site-defined
    additional fields to be passed to loadDHCPPacket().
    
  * All databases now offer optional case-insensitive modes of operation, with
    all SQL-schema examples describing how to bake this in for better
    operational efficiency.
    
  * Better support for (more) arguments.
  
  * conf.py can now be located anywhere.
    - Either set the environment variable STATICDHCPD_CONF_PATH or supply it
      as an argument with --config
  
  * No more warnings: all logging
  
  * Complete rewrites of the following subsystems:
    - Logging: now uses Python's logging facility
    - Web: now completely extensible and definable through extensions
    - Stats: now an event system integrated with extensions
    - DHCP: streamlined, more efficient, and less-confusing (within core logic)
    - Databases: fully embraced custom databases, with love for subclassing
      against builtins
    Everything's still compatible with old configurations, though!
    
  * Added new officially supported extension modules:
    - dynamism: dynamic address allocation
    - feedservice: provides an ATOM feed that reads logging events
    - httpdb: generic REST-JSON webservice database
      (usable, but also a good example for building your own)
    - recent_activity: web-interface component to monitor DHCP activity, with
      fancy graphs
    - statistics: all the goodness of the old stats stuff, with more
      flexibility, but now it's optional if you don't want it
      
  * SIGTERM (^C) now causes immediate termination if received while the system
    is already in a shutting-down state.

  * The difference between PXE and ProxyDHCP is now handled properly.

staticdhcpd (1.6.4) stable; urgency=low

  * Backported a feature from 2.0.0 that lets users define their own custom
    database engines without needing to touch the core code.
  
 -- Neil Tallim <flan@uguu.ca>  Mon, 01 Apr 2013 00:00:00 -0600

staticdhcpd (1.6.3) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixed a long-standing issue in which PXE clients that sent broadcast
    packets containing `ciaddr` were responded to via broadcast, rather than
    unicast to that `ciaddr` value.
  
 -- Neil Tallim <flan@uguu.ca>  Thu, 28 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0600

staticdhcpd (1.6.2) stable; urgency=low

  * Refactored the database component, breaking coupling to SQL
  
  * Implemented support for using an INI file as an alternative to an SQL-based
    database, borrowing from contributions by John Stowers
  
 -- Neil Tallim <flan@uguu.ca>  Tue, 19 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0600

staticdhcpd (1.6.1) stable; urgency=low

  * Massive re-architecture of the directory structures
    - staticDHCPd and libpydhcpserver now separated
    - conf/ directory added for source-based testing and deployment
    - /etc/staticDHCPd/ now recognised as a configuration path
    
  * Better deployment and operation logic
    - Setup scripts for both components of the system
    - Basic unified installer
      - Upgrade-friendly
    - Platform auto-detection and initscript-setup-help
    - No more need for hacks to access custom modules imported relative to
      `conf.py`
    
  * Fixed a tab-based indentation issue in 1.6.0 (thanks to John Stowers for
    pointing it out)
  
  * `main.py` is now `staticDHCPd`
  
 -- Neil Tallim <flan@uguu.ca>  Mon, 18 Mar 2013 00:00:00 -0600

staticdhcpd (1.5.7) stable; urgency=low

  * PXE will now work even when ALLOW_LOCAL_DHCP is False. This failed before
    because PXE is strictly unicast, so it doesn't use a relay, even when the
    other half of the negotiation does.
  
 -- Neil Tallim <flan@uguu.ca>  Sun, 29 Apr 2012 00:00:00 -0600

staticdhcpd (1.5.6) stable; urgency=low

  * Fixes a significant issue that prevented special DHCP options from being
    parsed, with thanks to Aditya Kulkarni.
    
  * Fixes an issue that, despite what 1.5.3 said, prevented PXE from working
    properly, since the socket was never checked for pending data.
    
  * Fixes the lack of e-mail timeouts and allows ports to be specified.
  
 -- Neil Tallim <flan@uguu.ca>  Thu, 29 Mar 2012 00:00:00 -0600

staticdhcpd (1.5.5) stable; urgency=low

  * Primarily a bugfix release, and one long overdue.
  
  * Addresses a number of issues affecting REBIND behaviour and errant NAKs
    (issue 7).
    
  * Adds Python 2.5 backwards-compatibility thanks to a patch from Mark
    Schloesser.
    
  * Fixes an error-logging issue that caused still more errors to be thrown,
    with thanks again to Mark (issue 8).
    
  * Fixes issues related to in-code typos that prevent custom attributes from
    being set correctly in DHCP packets (issue 10).
    
  * Added some diagnosis logic and a strToPaddedList() function based on
    patches from Andrew Xuan.
